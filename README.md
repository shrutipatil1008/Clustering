Enhancing Cluster Analysis with Explainable AI (Masterâ€™s Thesis)
ðŸ“… Sept 2023 â€“ Present

- Conducting in-depth data research on clustering spatiotemporal data using Python to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Developing and implementing a phased approach to enhance cluster interpretability with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.
- Evaluating multiple clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to determine the most effective method for analyzing spatial and temporal patterns.
- Visualizing cluster outputs with Matplotlib and Seaborn to improve decision-making and model transparency.
- Documenting findings and preparing reports for future reference and academic contributions.

Data Clustering on Sales Products
ðŸ“… Mar 2024 â€“ July 2024

- Performed data-driven research on sales product clustering, leading to optimized revenue grouping and market segmentation.
- Explored and compared various clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, Agglomerative, Gaussian Mixture Models) to determine the most effective sales categorization approach.
- Developed automated data preprocessing pipelines using Pandas and NumPy, ensuring high-quality input for clustering models.
- Validated clustering results by leveraging Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Elbow Method to measure model performance.
- Created interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau to present insights and support business decisions.
